% Assumes: pmat.py and loadtxt.m have been run
% Notes: 'channels' is an m = 239766 by n = 16 matrix
% provided by loadtxt.m which has been put in another
% script to facilitate debugging

Max = max(channels); %get the extreme values in entire dataset
Min = min(channels);

% plot(channels(:,1)); %this is the first channel

% compute 16 choose 2 = 120 features on input data by maximal cross correlation

%compute on 5second frame, which = 2000 samples at 400Hz
%compute 120 of these for each pair on 5s intervals
%a lag (tau) of 0.5s is 200 samples, so we provide 
nChannels = 16;
sampleRate = 400;
lagBySamples = sampleRate * 0.5; %lag by +/- 0.5s = 200

    f=1; %an index for the correlation vector
    %featureVector = zeros(54,1);

    %compute all the frames at once between a pair of channels
    for n=1:frameSize:featureSize; % 54 frames in 4.5min feature, increment by 2000

    movieMatrix(x,:) = featureVector; %movie will have M choose 2 = 120 rows, length 54 features   
    
end

% now have movieMatrix which contains 120 features with 54 terms representing 4.5 mins of data.
